## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 150°C. Season the beef with salt and pepper and then dust in some flour.
2. Place a large casserole dish with a dash of oil in, over a medium heat. Add the beef until coloured on all sides.
3. Add the carrots, onions, garlic and herbs and stir for 2 minutes.
4. Pour in the ale and scrape all the bits from the bottom. Boil for 2 minutes then stir in the purée and stock and bring to a simmer. Mix well and then cover with a lid and place in the oven for 2 and half hours.
5. Whilst cooking, make the dumplings by placing the flour and suet in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and the mustard. Mix to combine, then add a dash of warm water to form a thick dough.
6. With floured hands roll the dough into 8-12 balls.
7. Remove the stew from the oven then increase the temperature to 180°C. Place the dumplings in the stew so they float on top. Replace the lid and put back in the oven for 20-25 minutes, if you want crispy dumplings remove the lid for the last 10 minutes.
