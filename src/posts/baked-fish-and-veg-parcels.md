## Ingredients

* Any vegetables lying around, like courgettes, peas
* A bunch of spring onions, trimmed
* 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* 1 tsp thyme
* some parsley
* 3–4tbsp olive oil
* 2 fish fillets (150–200g each), such as cod or haddock
* About 200ml white wine or cider
* Sea salt and black pepper
* Cooked whole grains (30–60g per serving), to serve

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C and have ready a large baking tray with a rim (so no juices can escape). Tear off two large sheets of greaseproof paper or foil.
2. Cut the veg into thin ribbons or fine slices. Pile the veg in the middle of each sheet of paper or foil, and add the garlic, thyme, parsley if using, and two tablespoons of the olive oil. Season with a pinch of salt and a twist of pepper. Toss together well with your hands.
3. Place a fish fillet on top of each pile and season it with salt and pepper. Gather up the edges of the paper or foil and bring them up around the veg and fish. Pour a good splash of wine, cider, stock or passata into each parcel.
4. Crimp the top edges of the parcel together. With foil, you'll be able to seal the package completely; with paper, you can just scrunch it up so the fish is mostly covered. Place the parcels carefully on the baking tray. Bake in the oven for 15–20 minutes or until the fish is cooked through and the veg is just done (it will still be al dente).
5. In the meantime, cook grains, whether rice, quinoa or oat groats.
6. Bring the parcels to the table and accompany with whole grains, to soak up the juices.
